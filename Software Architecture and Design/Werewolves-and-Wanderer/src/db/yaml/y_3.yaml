        The faded tapestries on the wall only hint at
                                the splendor which this room once had. There is
                                a window to the west. By craning your neck through
                                it to the right you can see the castle entrance.
      choices:
      - Leave by north

          You are in the hallway entrance to the castle.
                                It is dark and gloomy, and the air of decay and
                                desolation is very depressing. You suddenly feel
                                very frightened.
        choices:
        - Run away
        - Proceed through South Door
