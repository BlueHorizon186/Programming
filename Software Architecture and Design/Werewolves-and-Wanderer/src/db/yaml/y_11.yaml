        You are in the prison guardroom, in the basement
                              of the castle. The stairwell ends in this room. There is
                              one other exit, a small hole in the east wall. The air is
                              damp and unpleasant... a chill wind rushes into the room
                              from gaps in the stone at the top of the walls.
